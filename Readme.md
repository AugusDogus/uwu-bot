# uwu

## Requirements

- Node.js (for development)
- Docker
- A [discord bot](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) token

## Building & Running

    $ git clone https://github.com/augusdogus/uwu-bot
    $ cd uwu-bot
    $ docker build -t uwu-bot .
    $ docker run --name uwu-bot -e "token=REPLACE_ME" uwu-bot:latest

### If you just want to run the bot and not build it yourself, I've build the image and uploaded it to dockerhub for you.
